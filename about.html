<p>Hi &#128512; My name is Ravi Murugesan. I have been a workshop facilitator and online course developer with the <a href="https://www.authoraid.info/en/">AuthorAID project</a> for about ten years.</p>

<p>In the course of my training work, I have realised that there are tons of resources available online on scientific authorship, but what is perhaps missing is some structure or guidance for the inexperienced researcher to navigate through these, to identify the high-quality ones, and most of all, to have a sense of the big picture and how things fit together. And that is the purpose I hope to fulfil through the collection of freely available resources on this website. I plan to keep updating it as I discover and vet new resources.</p>

<p>I have personally checked each resource to assure myself of its quality and relevance, and I have no commercial interest in adding any particular resource to the collection. This website is a personal project.</p>

<p>P.S. The name of this website is inspired by a common structure for scientific research papers: IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion).</p>
