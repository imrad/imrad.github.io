<div style="background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
	Making sense of scientific papers can be hard work. If you're just starting out to read journal papers (or think back to the time you did), there's a good chance of experiencing an imposter syndrome. But reading papers is a skill and can be learnt. And only by extensive reading of previous research in your area will you be in a strong position to chart a direction for your own research.
